##The janitor of a high school is extremely efficient.
# By the end of each day, all of the schoolâ€™s waste is in plastic bags weighing between 1.01 pounds and 3.00 pounds.
# All plastic bags are then taken to the trash bins outside. One trip is described as selecting a number of bags which
# together do not weigh more than 3.00 pounds, dumping them in the outside trash can and returning to the school.
# Given the number of plastic bags, and the weights of each bag,
# determine the minimum number of trips the janitor has to make.
